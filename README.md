# 📄 Chat with a PDF using RAG Pipeline 🚀

Welcome to **Chat with your PDF** — a project that leverages a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline for intelligent and interactive conversations with PDF documents. This project uses **semantic chunking** and **Cohere's AI models** for both semantic search and text generation, providing contextual responses. The user interface is powered by **Streamlit**, making it easy and intuitive to interact with the app.

## 📚 Features

- **Semantic Chunking**: Splits PDF content into semantically meaningful chunks for better answer quality.
- **Cohere for Embeddings**: Utilizes **Cohere's embedding model** for powerful semantic search capabilities.
- **Cohere for Text Generation**: Uses **Cohere's generation model** for generating responses during interactions.
- **Streamlit GUI**: Built with **Streamlit**, allowing seamless interaction with the PDF through a chat interface using `chat_messages` and `session_state` for session persistence.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Backend logic and data processing.
- **Cohere**: AI models for embeddings and text generation.
- **Streamlit**: Frontend for an interactive user interface.
- **LangChain**: For semantic chunking and retrieval processing.
